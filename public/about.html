		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Hello! My name is Connor and I am working on my first web development project. Thanks to Angela Yu's Udemy course</p>

		<p>I have been interested in learning more about web development for a while. I worked with HTML and Java a small amount in college, 
		and this year I have been working on personal projects in Python. After much time, I finally decided to take the jump and learn about full-stack web development.</p>

		<p>I've been an IT technician for quite some time, and I am very eager to do more creative work. 
		By this time next year, I will be proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and other development frameworks used in web development</p>

		<p>I take criticism well, so let me know if there is anything I can improve with my website! Thanks!</p>
